What is the return to education and is it changing over time? These are questions that keep coming up whenever a country, state, investors in education and family heads try to make decisions on ‘educational investments’-a key part of growth. These decisions are continually being made at the state and national levels involving policies, for example to increase college enrollment rates as well as by institutions such as the World Bank (1995) to make education sector loans. These decisions normally apply to the education system, and what is most relevant is the expected rate of return to society on investment in education as a whole that does take institutional costs into account (Arias & McMahon, 2001). Majority of modern literature on this the topic suggest that ‘better’ education is highly positively correlated with higher wages, more employment and prestigious jobs. Is this relationship changing over time? Although most literature supports the changing returns to education over time, one must practice caution drawing strong causal conclusions about the return to education for some specific occupations and how that changes over the course of time. This paper analyzes the return to education for economist. The continues development of new technology and availability of more data is expected to increase the effectiveness, efficiency and impact of the work of an economist, and thus the rise in returns to education for economist over time. The Data set was extracted from The Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS-USA) website from the American Community Survey (ACS) for the years 2010 to 2018. The occupation here is economist - a professional working in one of the many fields of economics or having an academic degree in economics. The sample is limited to only the employed. The average wage in the sample is 57.17 dollars, 61.11 and 49.42 dollars for men and women respectively. The age was trimmed to include only individuals between the ages 25 and 59 years. The data consist of rich information about individuals, states, years and a wide range of corresponding characteristics. The data initially included elementary, middle, secondary and graduate economist. We eliminated from our data set anyone who works 26 weeks or less out of the year and anyone who works less than 20 hours per week or more than 60 hours per week leaving us 1,860 number of observations with 1232 males and 628 females. Using Instrumental Variable (IV), Two Stage Least Square (2SLS) techniques, and fixed effect modeling with interactions, we try to estimate the causal effect and dynamics of level of education on log wages of economist using quarter of birth as our instrument for level of education. We found that controlling for age, state and year fixed effects, an additional year of schooling for economist is associated with 7.8% increase in hourly wages. We estimated the highest year of return to education being a 11.6% returns to hourly wages for an additional year of schooling in the year 2015 and 11.1 % in 2017. The returns to education for the remaining years hovers between 8% and 9%. Thus, we did not find any trend in the returns to education for economist across time although the return differ across time.
