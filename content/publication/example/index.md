abstract: 
The purpose of this thesis is to study the dependence structure of exchange rate
pairs using a mixture of copula as opposed to a single copula approach. Mixed
copula models have the ability to generate dependence structures that do not belong
to existing copula families. The flexibility in choosing component copulas in this
mixture model aids the construction of a system that is simultaneously parsimonious
and flexible enough to generate most dependence patterns in exchange rate data.
Furthermore, the method of mixture copulas facilitates the separation of both the
structure and degree of dependence, concepts that are respectively embodied in two
essential and distinct parameters for the study of dependence – the weight parameters
and the association parameters. The model proposed was constructed to capture
various dependence patterns using carefully chosen mixtures of Gaussian, Gumbel and
Clayton copulas. We used a two stage semi-parametric approach by first estimating
the marginal distributions of each exchange rate pair non-parametrically, and then
plugging in the empirical CDF’s into the copula. The empirical findings of this
experimental study shows a high tendency that each of the exchange rate pairs would
either appreciate or depreciate together against the US dollars and that relationship is
stronger than that implied by the Gaussian assumption. Our proposed copula mixture
model therefore adequately represents the dependence function which appropriately
captures the dependence structure between each of the exchange rate pairs in this
experimental study. The implications for these findings will be useful for central
bank’s monetary policies aimed at exchange rate price stabilization as well as for
other stake holders in the exchange rates business. It can also be applied to a wide
range of analysis in economics, finance, health, engineering, biology and other related
disciplines.
