My most rewarding experience as a Mathematics student is how it has changed my whole way of looking at things. Now, I like to disintegrate everything down to their numerical & logical essentials and analyze the underlying patterns.
Currently, I am pursuing MS in Mathematical Economics at the  Western Kentucky University, USA. I am also working as a graduate teaching assistant at the WKU Mathematics Department. A few years back, I acquired a Bachelors degree from the Departments of Economics and Mathematics, University of Cape Coast, Ghana.
I am very much passionate about the field of Economics and Data Science and aspire to be a Data Scientist in future. On a personal side, I enjoy nature, active sports, music, traveling and volunteering.
