Currently, I am a second year Economics PhD.(Health Economics) student at the university of Colorado, Denver. I hold an MS degree in Mathematics (Mathematical Economics) from Western Kentucky University, USA. Also,  a few years back, I acquired a Bachelors degree from the Departments of Economics and Mathematics at the University of Cape Coast, Ghana.
I am immensely passionate about the field of Economics and Data Science and aspire to be an Economist in future. During my free time, I enjoy nature, active sports, music, traveling and volunteering.
