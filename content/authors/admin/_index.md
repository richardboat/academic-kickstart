My work focuses on health economics and outcomes research (HEOR), cost-effectiveness analysis, and applied causal inference. I specialize in evaluating the economic, clinical, and labor market impacts of health policies and healthcare interventions using real-world and administrative data.

I am a recent PhD graduate in Health Economics. My doctoral research consists of three dissertation chapters. The first chapter estimates the causal impact of the Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid expansion on job security using longitudinal panel data and quasi-experimental methods, including difference-in-differences and individual fixed effects, combining state level variation in the Medicaid expansion and individual level heterogeneity in identifying the effect of the policy. 

My second chapter analyzes the impact of Medicaid expansion on hospital reported costs for giving care, exploiting cross-county variation in pre-expansion uninsurance rates to identify treatment effects of the policy. 

My third chapter examines the causal effect of secondary education on TEEN health outcomes (doctors’ visits, probability of health event and duration of health event) using  proximity to the nearest high school from an individual’s residence as an instrument for completing at least one year of high school education.

My work draws on large administrative and observational/survey datasets such as PSID, SPARCS and the Ghana Living Standards Survey datasets. Across projects, my goal is to translate methodologically rigorous evidence into decision-relevant insights for policymakers, healthcare organizations, and life sciences stakeholders.
